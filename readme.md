# Forex Intraday Trading with Genetic Algorithm over ANN

## Introduction

This project implements a Forex Intraday trading algorithm that utilizes a Genetic Algorithm over an Artificial Neural Network (ANN). The algorithm is designed for predicting short-term currency exchange rate movements.

This project is based on the paper "Utilizing artificial neural networks and genetic algorithms to
build an algo-trading model for intra-day foreign exchange speculation" by Cain Evans, Konstantinos Pappas, Fatos Xhafa.

## Installation

Clone the repository and install the required dependencies.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rishijain55/Forex-ML.git
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Run the `main.ipynb` notebook to train the model and test it on the test data.

The dataset used for training and testing is the DBP/USD currency pair data with 1-minute intervals.
